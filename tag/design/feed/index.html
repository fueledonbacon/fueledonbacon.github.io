				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Right Tools For A Digital Designer</h2>
<p><a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/creative-design/">Being a digital designer is a profession that requires the practice and use of multiple tools at the same time.</a> Each one is for something different, and each is needed for a step in the process in the right direction. Here are the top 6 tools every digital designer should use to maximize their work and skills.</p>
<h2>Adobe Photoshop</h2>
<p>A tool that by far offers the most tools to change up photographs and get you the highest quality is <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a>. While there is a learning curve, they offer a large number of tutorials. After that, it will all see very easy. Editing photos to be anything you want will be a breeze, making meeting client needs a simple task.</p>
<p>Being a digital designer you learn that computer system software to run your digital camera is a need. Back in the day a designer used to need a dark room to edit and work on pictures. Now, software like Adobe Photoshop can help a digital designer easily get their work done. While there is a wide array of options as far as photo editing is concerned, by far the best available is Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<h2>Adobe XD</h2>
<p>A unique tool,<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html?sdid=12B9F15S&amp;mv=Search&amp;ef_id=EAIaIQobChMI1Yfro-Pw4AIVGZ7ACh365gbnEAAYASAAEgIY6fD_BwE:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!315233774112!e!!g!!adobe%20xd"> Adobe XD</a> gives a digital designer the precision, speed, and quality to iterate, change and share prototypes with anyone. Be it team members and reviewers across devices and platforms, including Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, with Adobe XD multiple eyes can be on a project to ensure goals are being met.</p>
<h2>Adobe Illustrator</h2>
<p>A must have software is <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a>. Adobe Illustrator is software for creating illustrations, drawings, and artwork using a computer. It was released in 1987, continues to be updated, and is now included as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud. It is mostly used by graphic designers, web designers, visual artists, and professional illustrators to create art, logos, etc. A huge feature and benefit, Adobe Illustrator includes sophisticated drawing tools that reduce the time needed to be put into a project.</p>
<h2>Adobe Premiere Pro</h2>
<p>No matter your skill level, you need to have <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>. Adobe Premiere Pro is a tool for video editing that is able to easily be used by amateur enthusiasts and professionals alike. It can be purchased and used alone, or it can be used in conjunction with Adobe Photoshop and other tools as well.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere is a powerful editing tool because it is capable of producing high-definition video. Amongst video enthusiasts and professionals it is a popular package. In the community, the only tools that are more powerful than Adobe Premiere Pro are the ones used for the highest quality television video work.</p>
<h2>Adobe Lightroom</h2>
<p>Lightroom acts as a catalog for every image you take. It was made to help you import, process, review and store thousands upon thousands of photos. Whenever you take new images, you&#8217;re importing them from your camera or SD card to your Lightroom catalog. On your hard drive, they&#8217;re stored as normal so you can access them from any program. A big help is the ability to add keywords, titles, captions, the model’s name, and other image specific metadata for searching and filtering purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">Adobe Lightroom</a> does a great job of making it easy to go through and pull out the best images you have separated from your others. With the ability to flag photos and rate them from 1-5, you can quickly see the best pictures you have. What separates Adobe Lightroom from other tools is its in depth and powerful cataloging capabilities. Other apps like Apple Photos or Picasa can store your photos, but they don’t have nearly as many options when it comes to categorizing and sorting them.</p>
<h2>Mac Book Pro</h2>
<p>The Apple Macintosh was the first computer to truly allow for Digital Typography. Over 25 years ago, John and Thomas Knoll built the first version of Photoshop on a Macintosh computer. They built it on a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">Mac</a> because it was the only computer with a color display and the capacity to handle what they were actually building. It was released exclusively for the Mac in 1990. The Knolls pitched Photoshop to two companies in Silicon Valley: Adobe and Apple. Since then, there has always been a great partnership between the two bodies and therefore have grown and adapted together.</p>
<p>The reason a digital designer may gravitate to buying a Mac and are looked down on in the industry if they don’t is mostly a matter of tradition, not substance. There are a lot of strong reasons to use Mac above a PC. It would be better to use a Mac when using Thunderbolt 2 for large file transfers and connecting to 4K monitors. Or when you are integrating a workflow that uses other Apple devices such as the iPad and iPhone. Using a Mac would make that process so much easier. Another great reason is if you’re a Motion Graphic Designer that uses Apple Motion and Final Cut Pro in addition to your Adobe applications. These services and tools work so well together, it makes sense to use them in conjunction with one another. And the bottom line is that some people do indeed just prefer Macs or PCs.</p>
<h2>Be The Best Designer You Can Be</h2>
