<p>The world is changing so fast. So if you want to stand out these days, you have to be able to garnish the attention of potential customers and build a relationship. For small businesses, the challenge is finding their audience and grabbing attention with intent on possibly <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/digital-marketing/">finding new customers.</a> Most mediums are now flooded with incredibly attention grabbing articles, images, and video. How can you compete? First off, don&#8217;t be tempted to make high quality content right away. For those that are just beginning, it is much easier to lower the bar for quality. This way you can understand what it means to produce content at-scale.</p>
<h2>Problems With Great Content</h2>
<p>Content only comes from experience developing content. You need to know the right message to highlight. You need to know the right medium to use to reach the right audience. Likewise, If viral content is your goal, you will likely not climb the metaphorical Mount Everest of viral content on your first try.</p>
<p>Content must be filtered and morphed from good content. Remember, the first article you write, or vlog you create, the first version of your ‘good content’ will likely have to adapt to reach a larger audience or a more refined message.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/kelsey-libert/interview-how-to-create-viral-content.html">Thus, great content is not viral content.</a></p>
<h2>Advantages of Good Content</h2>
<p>First: Good content can be produced much faster than great content.<br />
Second: Good content is easier to produce.<br />
Third: Good content allows for experimentation.<br />
Fourth: Good content allows for more communication to your potential audiences.</p>
<h2>Faster.</h2>
<p>You should time-box the content you create to be limited to 1hr per piece of content. Unfortunately, by creating content faster, it is likely that the overall quality will have to drop. But don&#8217;t worry! This is acceptable. You need to be able to float before you can swim. If you don’t set a time limit to creating content, there is a high likelihood of not completing it at all. Just get started.</p>
<h2>Easier.</h2>
<p>Once you are creating content, you will start to bring in new techniques and tools to help you reach your goal of creating time-boxed content. These tools and techniques, templates for structure, pre-writing and the like, will help you meet the goal of time-boxed content much faster. As a result, you will be able to focus on aspects of improvement that you can make to your process of creating content.</p>
<h2>Experimentation.</h2>
<p>You are now creating regular content and you have had a few different pieces (articles, videos, etc) that are actually good. It’s time to search the market to see what others are creating. Borrow and steal styles and concepts to see how you can integrate new aspects into your own content: Message, Method, and Medium. Although, remember to experiment with one thing at a time.</p>
<h2>Lifecycle of Content Development</h2>
<p>Concept &#8211; Kaizen &#8211; or ‘continuous improvement’ is the idea that you can make many small improvements over time, rather than engineering a complete solution the first try.<br />
0 &#8211; Guess a Way Through Creating your first Content<br />
1 &#8211; Create Bad Content Consistently &#8211; and throw it out<br />
2 &#8211; Create A Process that Helps Generate Better Content<br />
3 &#8211; Experiment with Your Process Until You Generate Better content<br />
4 &#8211; Develop Consistent Good Content<br />
5 &#8211; Experiment with Good Content to Find What Would Make it Great.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, if the act of <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/creative-design/">creating content</a> is still foreign to you, you need to learn how to generate content consistently before you will be able to generate Great Content. In other words, trying to generate Great Content from the start is a trap that will prevent you from producing enough or worse create rigid processes that will limit the amount of experimentation necessary to keep up with the changing trends in the market.</p>
