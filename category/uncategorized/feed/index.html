				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Right Tools For A Digital Designer</h2>
<p><a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/creative-design/">Being a digital designer is a profession that requires the practice and use of multiple tools at the same time.</a> Each one is for something different, and each is needed for a step in the process in the right direction. Here are the top 6 tools every digital designer should use to maximize their work and skills.</p>
<h2>Adobe Photoshop</h2>
<p>A tool that by far offers the most tools to change up photographs and get you the highest quality is <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Adobe Photoshop</a>. While there is a learning curve, they offer a large number of tutorials. After that, it will all see very easy. Editing photos to be anything you want will be a breeze, making meeting client needs a simple task.</p>
<p>Being a digital designer you learn that computer system software to run your digital camera is a need. Back in the day a designer used to need a dark room to edit and work on pictures. Now, software like Adobe Photoshop can help a digital designer easily get their work done. While there is a wide array of options as far as photo editing is concerned, by far the best available is Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<h2>Adobe XD</h2>
<p>A unique tool,<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html?sdid=12B9F15S&amp;mv=Search&amp;ef_id=EAIaIQobChMI1Yfro-Pw4AIVGZ7ACh365gbnEAAYASAAEgIY6fD_BwE:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!315233774112!e!!g!!adobe%20xd"> Adobe XD</a> gives a digital designer the precision, speed, and quality to iterate, change and share prototypes with anyone. Be it team members and reviewers across devices and platforms, including Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, with Adobe XD multiple eyes can be on a project to ensure goals are being met.</p>
<h2>Adobe Illustrator</h2>
<p>A must have software is <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a>. Adobe Illustrator is software for creating illustrations, drawings, and artwork using a computer. It was released in 1987, continues to be updated, and is now included as part of the Adobe Creative Cloud. It is mostly used by graphic designers, web designers, visual artists, and professional illustrators to create art, logos, etc. A huge feature and benefit, Adobe Illustrator includes sophisticated drawing tools that reduce the time needed to be put into a project.</p>
<h2>Adobe Premiere Pro</h2>
<p>No matter your skill level, you need to have <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html">Adobe Premiere Pro</a>. Adobe Premiere Pro is a tool for video editing that is able to easily be used by amateur enthusiasts and professionals alike. It can be purchased and used alone, or it can be used in conjunction with Adobe Photoshop and other tools as well.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere is a powerful editing tool because it is capable of producing high-definition video. Amongst video enthusiasts and professionals it is a popular package. In the community, the only tools that are more powerful than Adobe Premiere Pro are the ones used for the highest quality television video work.</p>
<h2>Adobe Lightroom</h2>
<p>Lightroom acts as a catalog for every image you take. It was made to help you import, process, review and store thousands upon thousands of photos. Whenever you take new images, you&#8217;re importing them from your camera or SD card to your Lightroom catalog. On your hard drive, they&#8217;re stored as normal so you can access them from any program. A big help is the ability to add keywords, titles, captions, the model’s name, and other image specific metadata for searching and filtering purposes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html">Adobe Lightroom</a> does a great job of making it easy to go through and pull out the best images you have separated from your others. With the ability to flag photos and rate them from 1-5, you can quickly see the best pictures you have. What separates Adobe Lightroom from other tools is its in depth and powerful cataloging capabilities. Other apps like Apple Photos or Picasa can store your photos, but they don’t have nearly as many options when it comes to categorizing and sorting them.</p>
<h2>Mac Book Pro</h2>
<p>The Apple Macintosh was the first computer to truly allow for Digital Typography. Over 25 years ago, John and Thomas Knoll built the first version of Photoshop on a Macintosh computer. They built it on a <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">Mac</a> because it was the only computer with a color display and the capacity to handle what they were actually building. It was released exclusively for the Mac in 1990. The Knolls pitched Photoshop to two companies in Silicon Valley: Adobe and Apple. Since then, there has always been a great partnership between the two bodies and therefore have grown and adapted together.</p>
<p>The reason a digital designer may gravitate to buying a Mac and are looked down on in the industry if they don’t is mostly a matter of tradition, not substance. There are a lot of strong reasons to use Mac above a PC. It would be better to use a Mac when using Thunderbolt 2 for large file transfers and connecting to 4K monitors. Or when you are integrating a workflow that uses other Apple devices such as the iPad and iPhone. Using a Mac would make that process so much easier. Another great reason is if you’re a Motion Graphic Designer that uses Apple Motion and Final Cut Pro in addition to your Adobe applications. These services and tools work so well together, it makes sense to use them in conjunction with one another. And the bottom line is that some people do indeed just prefer Macs or PCs.</p>
<h2>Be The Best Designer You Can Be</h2>
<p>These are just some our of favorite tools to use, which we recommend to digital designers. What are some of your favorite tools to use? Did we name all of yours? If not share this blog and write what some of your favorites are. We&#8217;d love to know and try them out!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Project Managers Are Amazing</h2>
<p>Whether you are on a team doing <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/web-development/">web development</a>, <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/digital-marketing/">digital marketing</a>, or involved in <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/creative-design/">creative work</a> of some kind, let&#8217;s agree on one thing. <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/client-services/">Project Management, Client Services</a>, and Project Managers never get the love they deserve. These men and women form the backbone of any great agency, and are influential in so many ways.  A Project Manager is always there when needed and always go above and beyond what is required of them. This ranges from assisting clients, to managing reputation, or employing extreme problem solving skills.</p>
<p>Here are 8 steps to being an amazing Project Manager!</p>
<h2>Lay the Tracks Before the Train Gets There</h2>
<p>Before any agreement is made between you, your agency, and your client, you should lay a strong foundation &#8211; a clear and concise path for the train to travel down. Establish how you will communicate with your client so there are no hangups in the approval process. Know what you can promise, and how long those things will take. Setting up expectations beforehand is essential in delivering on time. <a href="https://redbooth.com/blog/managing-projects-infographic">Creating a roadmap of your progress</a> shows the entire team where they are, what is left to accomplish, and where things may be lagging. Creating work tickets and checklists ensure that the project stays on track. Have your tools polished and organized. Simply put, be prepared. As a project manager, this is the best way to tackle potential obstacles, and avoid derailing the train.</p>
<h2>Establish Client Rapport and Trust</h2>
<p>This is perhaps the most important step every Project Manager needs to consider with a new project. So much in the process involves client feedback and approval. Efficiency in communication here will save untold amounts of time and money for both parties. If the Project Manager has rapport with their client, messages can be shorter, things can be communicated faster, and through more convenient mediums. Trust will allow the client to speak candidly, directly, and ideas will be more accurately framed. Avoiding confusion and misinterpretation will streamline the approval process. <a href="https://www.inc.com/young-entrepreneur-council/6-ways-to-build-rapport-with-clients-colleagues.html">Effective communication equates to efficiency.</a> That is the golden ticket to being an amazing Project Manager.</p>
<h2>Be Consistent with Your Communication</h2>
<p>Texting your friends every minute? Too much communication. Calling your boyfriend or girlfriend all the time when you aren&#8217;t around? Too much communication. <a href="https://www.successagency.com/di/effective-client-communication/">Staying in touch your client on a daily, regular and consistent basis?</a> The perfect amount of communication. You never want your client to make assumptions about the work that is being done, or be desperately trying to talk with you about something. Have detailed meetings set in stone, that way your client can know when they will hear from you. Feel free to stay in touch when outside of those parameters to make sure your client is comfortable with that level of communication.</p>
<h2>Use the Right Tools for the Job</h2>
<p>Just as <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/creative-design/">designers</a>, <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/web-development/">developers</a>, and <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/digital-marketing/">marketers</a> have tools they need to accomplish their tasks, <a href="https://www.scoro.com/blog/best-project-management-software-list/">Project Managers have a slew of useful applications and programs at their disposal</a>. Whether it be a messaging platform, cloud-based storage, or time-tracking integrations, the most difficult part is choosing the perfect combination to make up their toolkit. There isn&#8217;t necessarily a right answer. As long as each system is properly vetted with research and experimentation, it really boils down to what you are comfortable working with. Because in the end, efficiencies are gained through repeated use and familiarity. If you want to maximize your impact as a Project Manager, take a moment to determine the best toolkit for your team.</p>
<h2>Flexibility and Adaptation over Mastery (unless you&#8217;re a master at being flexible)</h2>
<p>The tech world is renowned for being one thing above all else: ever-changing. Becoming an expert in a single area is almost never a bad idea, depending on the topic. But tides change so rapidly in this industry, and what once was at the forefront, can very easily be replaced with something new. If you or your team is incapable of adaptation, you might lose a competitive edge. <a href="https://www.ims-web.com/blog/the-critical-role-of-flexibility-in-project-management-processes">Being flexible is helpful in other areas as well</a>. Working with clients that change their minds often, or dealing with acts of god that disrupt your timeline, will be very challenging for a rigid Project Manager. When the winds of change come, you want to ensure you can bend with them, or else you&#8217;ll snap.</p>
<h2>Be An Available Project Manager</h2>
<p>As a Project Manager for an agency, or even for a small team, there may be times when you have a client, or coworker, in a different time zone. It is important in these cases that you are available if and when they need you. As inconvenient as it may seem, these are the small details that make great Project Managers and agencies stand out. Being as available as possible for your clients shows determination, dedication, and loyalty. Your clients will remember all of those traits are, and will take them into consideration when looking for future work to be done. The same can be said for your team. The Project Manager is the hub of communication between departments, and if they are hard to get ahold of, chances of success decrease. Be there for your team and they will be there for you.</p>
<h2><a href="https://tobyelwin.com/project-management-is-not-a-process-but-a-promise/">Deliver on Your Promises</a>, or Don&#8217;t Make Them</h2>
<p>Realistic expectations are the key to success in Project Management. Of course there will be times when push comes to shove. But the goal of a good Project Manager is to mitigate time loss and threats to the deadline. Use your team&#8217;s experience to accurately estimate the timeline for a project. Tell your client what is possible. Then deliver what you said you would. The worst thing you can do is promise the moon and fall short. However the best thing you can do is&#8230;.</p>
<h2>Always Overdeliver; Leave Them Wanting More</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve heard the old adage, <a href="https://theodigogroup.com/magic-promise-deliver/">&#8220;underpromise, overdeliver.&#8221;</a> Nowhere is this more true than in Project Management. Because you are the point of contact for the client, you are responsible for your team&#8217;s reputation in their eyes. Delivering a high quality product and excellent customer service will leave them with nothing but good things to say. And in the age of online reviews, this is both preferable and essential to the success of your company. So as the gatekeeper of that reputation, always overdeliver. Exceed their expectations every time and you&#8217;ll see no end to clients lining up to work with you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>What is Micro Marketing?</h2>
<p><a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/digital-marketing/">Marketing is a huge task</a>. With the Pay To Play mentality of a lot of social sites, companies are being encouraged to spend more marketing dollars. However, a lot of small businesses don&#8217;t have the budget to make waves in the pool of digital advertising and outreach. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/02/16/why-facebook-is-the-next-big-player-in-local-search/#736421b29c9b">Nearly half of all consumers are using social sites to discover new brands</a>. They are either searching for them directly through social media, or the brand is advertising to their target audience or location. Micro Marketing is a potential solution for businesses without those extra funds. It may allow them to run campaigns on social sites like Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Micro Marketing is the process of running small scale campaigns for only a few days at a time. One example might be an awareness campaign on Facebook for $5 or $6 for only 3-4 days. This gives you a daily spend of somewhere between $1-$2 a day. In the past, Fueled on Bacon has run similar campaigns and reached anywhere between 600-1,000 people.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Be Micro Marketing Now</h2>
<p>Micro Marketing is something that any small business can manage without help, and without breaking the bank. $5 a week comes out to $560 a year, and that is an expense that almost any business can undertake. Local businesses should focus on Micro Marketing because it is a gateway to potential customers who might not have found you otherwise. If you&#8217;re offering a special, or have a sale going on, put it up on social media and put $5 behind it in the form of a boosted post. Depending on the cost of what you are offering, even just one sale could cover that expense and then some.</p>
<h2>How to Run Micro Marketing Campaigns</h2>
<p>The best strategy to undertake when running a micro marketing campaign is to align them with specials, sales, and in-store offers. This gives incentive to the potential buyer who sees your ad, and gives them something to engage with online. Even if they don&#8217;t want to make a purchase, they might be inclined to share it with their friends and family, which further spreads your reach. All of those actions give the social sites something to learn about your advertising. It tells sites like Facebook that your ad is engaging and people want to see it. This could potentially lead to your ad getting boosted and put in front of even more people, or put in front of the same people more often, increasing the likelihood of click through.</p>
<h2>Where Micro Marketing Campaigns Should Be Run</h2>
<p>All marketing endeavors and strategies need to be planned and thoroughly researched before being put into action. This ensures you aren&#8217;t wasting money. With that being said, micro marketing campaigns should not be used on all platforms. In regards to the strategy previously outlined, this works best on social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. They give you much more control in allocating your money, without spending it too quickly.</p>
<p>It is important to be aware that micro marketing can mean different things depending on where the campaign is placed. For example, a normal Google Ads campaign could be somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 a month. A micro marketing campaign on Google Ads could be $500 &#8211; $1,000. Take this into consideration when thinking about where you want your ads placed.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Micro Marketing is advertising on specific social media platforms with a low budget and a short duration. These campaigns are great for research phases, finding the right audience, and testing content. Moreover, this strategy is perfect for small businesses who feel like they don&#8217;t have the budget to advertise. Micro Marketing campaigns should only be run on specific platforms. These campaigns need to monitored to ensure the budget isn&#8217;t being eaten away too quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;First create good content, then make it great&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:334403,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:[null,2,16777215],&quot;9&quot;:0,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:[null,2,0],&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;19&quot;:0,&quot;21&quot;:0}">First Create Good Content, Then Make It Great</span></h2>
<p>The world is changing so fast. So if you want to stand out these days, you have to be able to garnish the attention of potential customers and build a relationship. For small businesses, the challenge is finding their audience and grabbing attention with intent on possibly <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/digital-marketing/">finding new customers.</a> Most mediums are now flooded with incredibly attention grabbing articles, images, and video. How can you compete? First off, don&#8217;t be tempted to make high quality content right away. For those that are just beginning, it is much easier to lower the bar for quality. This way you can understand what it means to produce content at-scale.</p>
<h2>Problems With Great Content</h2>
<p>Content only comes from experience developing content. You need to know the right message to highlight. You need to know the right medium to use to reach the right audience. Likewise, If viral content is your goal, you will likely not climb the metaphorical Mount Everest of viral content on your first try.</p>
<p>Content must be filtered and morphed from good content. Remember, the first article you write, or vlog you create, the first version of your ‘good content’ will likely have to adapt to reach a larger audience or a more refined message.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inc.com/kelsey-libert/interview-how-to-create-viral-content.html">Thus, great content is not viral content.</a></p>
<h2>Advantages of Good Content</h2>
<p>First: Good content can be produced much faster than great content.<br />
Second: Good content is easier to produce.<br />
Third: Good content allows for experimentation.<br />
Fourth: Good content allows for more communication to your potential audiences.</p>
<h2>Faster.</h2>
<p>You should time-box the content you create to be limited to 1hr per piece of content. Unfortunately, by creating content faster, it is likely that the overall quality will have to drop. But don&#8217;t worry! This is acceptable. You need to be able to float before you can swim. If you don’t set a time limit to creating content, there is a high likelihood of not completing it at all. Just get started.</p>
<h2>Easier.</h2>
<p>Once you are creating content, you will start to bring in new techniques and tools to help you reach your goal of creating time-boxed content. These tools and techniques, templates for structure, pre-writing and the like, will help you meet the goal of time-boxed content much faster. As a result, you will be able to focus on aspects of improvement that you can make to your process of creating content.</p>
<h2>Experimentation.</h2>
<p>You are now creating regular content and you have had a few different pieces (articles, videos, etc) that are actually good. It’s time to search the market to see what others are creating. Borrow and steal styles and concepts to see how you can integrate new aspects into your own content: Message, Method, and Medium. Although, remember to experiment with one thing at a time.</p>
<h2>Lifecycle of Content Development</h2>
<p>Concept &#8211; Kaizen &#8211; or ‘continuous improvement’ is the idea that you can make many small improvements over time, rather than engineering a complete solution the first try.<br />
0 &#8211; Guess a Way Through Creating your first Content<br />
1 &#8211; Create Bad Content Consistently &#8211; and throw it out<br />
2 &#8211; Create A Process that Helps Generate Better Content<br />
3 &#8211; Experiment with Your Process Until You Generate Better content<br />
4 &#8211; Develop Consistent Good Content<br />
5 &#8211; Experiment with Good Content to Find What Would Make it Great.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To conclude, if the act of <a href="https://fueledonbacon.github.io/services/creative-design/">creating content</a> is still foreign to you, you need to learn how to generate content consistently before you will be able to generate Great Content. In other words, trying to generate Great Content from the start is a trap that will prevent you from producing enough or worse create rigid processes that will limit the amount of experimentation necessary to keep up with the changing trends in the market.</p>
